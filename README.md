# COMS4995 Project Proposal


## Application that Provides Restaraunts with Financial and Technological Services 

I want to create a full stack application that allows restaurants to have access to financial and technological advantages, similar to shopify, but with greater capabilities. Currently, I am interning for a startup called Weat (I've just accepted the offer yesterday (9/9/2020)), and I'm working with two highly intelligent Columbia Alumni, who are currently employed at BCG. I'm building an application for them from scratch to help them present their services. We are a team of two developers, Tommy Gomez, and myself. We hope that we can have a joint project for this class. We believe that teamwork is the only way to make the dreamwork, especially in engineering projects.

Firstly, we will build a feature that allows their customers to easily subscribe to weekly meal packages. This is in order to help restaurants revitalize their business by providing them with an alternative diverse revenue stream.

After this, we are looking to add more features such as financial reports, predictive customer activity, and even leveraging our platform's client's business data to provide insights that otherwise wouldn't be available. We are very much in the planning phase; we just have a rough idea of what we want to accomplish with this app.

I will need to use Git version control, React for the front end, and Python the backend. This class would be the perfect opportunity to recieve guidance in this workflow (that is quite new to me), and ultimately build a better application.

The COVID19 pandemic has brought restaurant businesses in a precarious position, with many facing or already experiencing closure. I truly believe that this application can help remedy the situation and have a positive social impact.

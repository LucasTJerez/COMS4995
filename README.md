# COMS4995 Project Proposal


## Application that Provides Restaraunts with Financial and Technological Services 

I want to create a full stack application that allows restaurants to have access to financial and technological advantages, similar to shopify, but with greater capabilities. Currently, Tommy Gomez and I (Lucas Jerez) am interning for a startup called Weat (we just have accepted the offer yesterday (9/9/2020)). We will be working with two highly intelligent Columbia alumni who are currently employed at BCG. We will be building an application from scratch with the features that are listed bellow. We are a team of two developers, and we hope that we can have a joint project for this class. We believe that teamwork is the only way to make the dream work, especially in engineering projects. We are both highly motivated and excited to start this project, and will be putting in similar amounts of work, as you will see in our future commits.

## Features

Firstly, we will build a feature that allows their customers to easily subscribe to weekly meal packages. This is in order to help restaurants revitalize their business by providing them with an alternative diverse revenue stream.

After this, we are looking to add more features such as financial reports, predictive customer activity, and even leveraging our platform's client's business data to provide insights that otherwise wouldn't be available. We are very much in the planning phase; we just have a rough idea of what we want to accomplish with this app.

## Closing Remarks

We will need to use Git version control, React for the front end, and Python the backend. This class would be the perfect opportunity to recieve guidance in this workflow (that is quite new to us), and ultimately build a better application.

The COVID19 pandemic has brought restaurant businesses in a precarious position, with many facing or already experiencing closure. I truly believe that this application can help remedy the situation and have a positive social impact.
